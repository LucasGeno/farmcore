## 2026-10-18 — FarmCore revamp

User authorized specification, tickets, private access first, independent feature chats, implementation agents, QA and integration. Published milestones 1–4 as a 12-ticket graph. Claude review incorporated with typed rules retained and evidence/validation caveats. No configured external tracker.

Independent spec QA: clarified coordinator-only migration authorship; owner membership revoke/disabled-user behavior; separate private/authenticated/demo test fixtures; ticket 11 now depends on recommendation review (06). Ticket01 explicitly closes operator-token privacy before member identity follows.

## 2026-10-18 — Dispatch and research delivery

- Integration branch `codex/farmcore-revamp`; draft PR https://github.com/LucasGeno/farmcore/pull/6.
- Access chat `01a150fa-4d94-7840-9845-c8783c9319bb`: tickets 01→02→03, checkout `/Users/Lucas.reed/.codex/worktrees/farmcore-private-access/FarmCore`, feature branch `codex/farmcore-private-access`.
- Weather chat `01a150fa-514f-7253-8c93-373858e739c0`: ticket04, checkout `/Users/Lucas.reed/.codex/worktrees/farmcore-live-weather/FarmCore`, feature branch `codex/farmcore-live-weather`.
- Independent spec QA clarified migration ownership, immediate membership revocation, safe test fixtures, capture ownership and review dependency. All incorporated before implementation integration.
- Research delivered to `/Users/Lucas.reed/Documents/lucas-vault/projects/EU Agri Hackathon/2026-10-18-project-case-studies.md`: 10 case studies + index + ecosystem/data note, linked existing event notes. Source-inspected, tests not executed; attribution/licence limitations explicit.
- Docker Desktop started and local PostGIS 17/3.5 dev server verified accepting connections on localhost55442. Existing test fixture creates a unique disposable database per session; no production migrations run.
- Remaining frontier after access02: reviewed parameters05 and audited corrections09. Planning07 needs weather04 + parameters05. Completion11 needs review06 + scheduling08 + broader capture10. Final independent QA12 follows all workstreams.
